🚀 Configuring Production-Ready EKS Clusters with Terraform and GitHub Actions

Welcome to the Configuring Production-Ready EKS Clusters with Terraform and Automating with GitHub Actions repository! This project demonstrates how to provision a fully functional and scalable Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using Terraform, and how to automate deployments and infrastructure changes using GitHub Actions.

🌟 Overview

This project focuses on building a robust DevOps workflow by combining the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with continuous integration and delivery:

✅ Features

Terraform: Declaratively provision EKS clusters, node groups, IAM roles, and networking components (VPC, subnets, etc.).

GitHub Actions: Automate Terraform workflows — plan, apply, and validate configurations via pull requests or pushes to main.

Production-Ready Config: Modular structure, state management, secrets handling, and best practices for scaling and security.

Serverless + AWS Native Services: (Optional) Integrate serverless components and AWS-native services where applicable.
